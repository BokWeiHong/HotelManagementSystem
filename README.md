## User Interface Requirements

### Design Principles

The user interface (UI) of the BKLT2 Hotel Management System is designed to be user-friendly, intuitive, and visually appealing. The use of two sets of Java APIs, AWT (Abstract Windowing Toolkit) and Swing, is essential for achieving these objectives.

#### AWT (Abstract Windowing Toolkit)

- **Introduction:** AWT was introduced in JDK 1.0 and provides a basic set of user interface components for building graphical user interfaces in Java applications.

- **Reasons for Deployment:**
  - **Legacy Support:** AWT components, though some have become obsolete, are still in use. The deployment of AWT allows compatibility with older systems and applications.
  - **Basic UI Components:** AWT includes fundamental UI components like buttons, text fields, and labels, providing a simple and lightweight approach to UI development.

#### Swing API (Java Foundation Classes - JFC)

- **Introduction:** Swing, introduced as part of Java Foundation Classes (JFC) after JDK 1.1, is a more comprehensive set of graphics libraries that enhances AWT.

- **Reasons for Deployment:**
  - **Advanced Components:** Swing offers a wide range of advanced UI components, including tables, trees, and scroll panes, making it suitable for creating a modern and feature-rich user interface.
  - **Look and Feel:** Pluggable Look-and-Feel Support in Swing allows for a customizable appearance, providing a more aesthetically pleasing user experience.
  - **Integration with JFC:** Swing is an integral part of JFC, which also includes Java2D, Accessibility, Internationalization, and Pluggable Look-and-Feel Support APIs.

### Software and Hardware Requirements

#### Software Requirements

- **Operating System:** Windows 10
- **Front End:**
  - Java
  - Integrated Development Environment (IDE): IntelliJ, NetBeans, or Visual Studio Code

- **Back End:**
  - Database: MySQL (MySQL Workbench 8.0 CE)

### Additional UI Considerations

- **Responsiveness:** The UI should be responsive, adapting to various screen sizes and resolutions.
- **Color Scheme:** Choose a visually appealing color scheme that aligns with the hotel's branding.
- **Intuitive Navigation:** Implement clear and intuitive navigation for seamless user interaction.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure the UI is accessible, following best practices for users with disabilities.
- **Consistency:** Maintain consistency in UI elements, layouts, and navigation throughout the application.
